Test case description:

This test targets the following, example loot table:

LootPool (uniform roll: 4-8) {
    {item: 0, weight: 10} with SetCountUniform(3,6),
    {item: 1, weight: 10} with SetCountUniform(2,5),
    {item: 2, weight: 5},
    {item: 3, weight: 1} with SetCountUniform(1,2),
    {item: 4, weight: 1},
    {item: 5, weight: 1}
}

The user provided the following constraints:

- at least 11 x item 3

Three kernel source codes were generated for these constraints:
- state prediction on roll count, source code kernel1.src
- naive bruteforce solution, source code kernel2.src
- state prediction on item type, source code kernel3.src
